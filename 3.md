# The Argon file structure

Your home directory on Argon is `/Users/hawkid`; you will start out here every time you log in.  All users are allowed 1 TB of storage in their home directory.

If you need more storage space than that, there are two other options worth knowing about:

* `/localscratch/Users/hawkid`
* `/nfsscratch`

Both of these are "scratch" space, meaning that files are subject to deletion 30 days after they were created.  Obviously, don't keep anything critical there, but if you're, say, writing a bunch of temporary files with intermediate results and need someplace to stash them, that's what the scratch space is for.  For more on the difference between the two scratch systems, [see here](https://wiki.uiowa.edu/display/hpcdocs/NFS+Scratch+File+System).

# Program files and modules

The list of programs installed on Argon is not large, but critically, R is one of those programs.  Argon uses modules to manage different versions of these applications, however, so you will need to load the appropriate R module before you can use it:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
module load R/3.5.1
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Note that 3.5.1 was the most recent R module at the time of this writing ({{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}), but there may be newer versions available.  To see the available modules, submit:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
module avail
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Argon does, however, have all the necessary tools to compile and install
software (C/python/perl compilers/interpreters/etc.), so you can install
applications yourself, [including R](11.html).

# Your profile

Typically, there are a few commands that you would like to run at the beginning
of every Argon session.  To do that, you can place them in a profile file, such
as `.bash_profile`.  This file should already exist when you log in for the
first time, ready for you to add things to it.  For example, this is what the
first few lines of my `.bash_profile` file look like:

{% include pre-file.html file=".bash_profile" %}
#!/bin/bash
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH:

module load R/3.5.1
alias R="R --no-save"
<...more...>
{% include post-file.html %}

This sets up the Linux search path so that the OS knows where your
user-installed applications are, and loads the R module.

# Your R profile

Since you'll likely be using `R` on Argon, and will likely have to install
packages, it's worth mentioning how to set up a local directory in which to install them (otherwise, `R` will ask you questions about it every time you run `install.packages()`).

Suppose you wanted to install all of your R packages into a directory called `.Rlib`.  You would start by making the directory:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
mkdir .Rlib
{% include post-prompt.html %}

And then tell `R` to use that as your local library by adding this
to your `.Rprofile` file (you may have to create this file first):

{% include pre-file.html file=".Rprofile" %}
.libPaths("~/.Rlib")
options(repos=c(CRAN="https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN"))
{% include post-file.html %}

The second line is optional, but will stop R from asking you about what mirror you want to use every time you install a package.
