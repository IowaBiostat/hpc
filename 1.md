# Connecting to Argon (Linux/Mac terminal)

You can connect to the Argon cluster on a Linux or Mac machine (or using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> on Windows) by opening a terminal and using ssh with your HawkID and password:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
ssh argon.hpc.uiowa.edu
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Note that if, on the machine you're using, your username is not the same as your HawkID, you'll have to specify your login username:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
ssh hawkid@argon.hpc.uiowa.edu
{% include post-prompt.html %}

By default, ssh uses port 22, which is blocked from outside connections by the University of Iowa network.  So if you are connecting from off-campus, you will have to specify port 40:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
ssh -p 40 argon.hpc.uiowa.edu
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Note, however, that you do not have to set up a VPN to connect to Argon.

Finally, you may be interested in the `-Y` flag:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
ssh -Y argon.hpc.uiowa.edu
{% include post-prompt.html %}

which allows X11 forwarding (e.g., if you try to plot something in R, a plot window will open).

# Connecting to Argon (Windows)

On a Windows machine, you can use <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> to connect to Argon in essentially the same way as above, only with a GUI interface.  Just be sure to specify:

<ul>
  <li> Connection: SSH (default)</li>
  <li> Host Name: argon.hpc.uiowa.edu</li>
  <li> Port: 22 (default) is fine on-campus, but you need to specify 40 if you're connecting from off-campus</li>
</ul>

You will then be prompted for your username (HawkID) and password.

# Connecting by Remote Desktop

It is also possible to connect to Argon by remote desktop using [FastX2](https://www.starnet.com/fastx), which you can download from  [ITS](https://helpdesk.its.uiowa.edu/software/download/fastx).  I have never personally done this, but instructions are available [here](https://wiki.uiowa.edu/display/hpcdocs/FastX+connections).  If anyone has tried this out and has any tips to share, let me know and I will make them available here.
