# Scripting qsub

Now that we know how to monitor jobs, let's return to `qsub` and discuss how to submit multiple jobs simultaneous.  One way is to script a loop that calls `qsub` many times (unfortunately, aliases aren't available in scripts, so we have to specify all the options):

{% include pre-file.html file="batch-sim" %}
#!/bin/bash
for ((i = 1; i <= 10; i++))
do
  qsub -cwd -V -e ~/err -o ~/out -q BIOSTAT sim $i
done
{% include post-file.html %}

Now we can run

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
./batch-sim
{% include post-prompt.html %}

which will make 10 requests to the batch scheduler, all of which should run and finish more or less simultaneously (unless there are less than 10 available processors on BIOSTAT).  After submitting this command, try monitoring the job with `qstat`.

# qsub arrays

A slightly less flexible, but far more convenient alternative, `qsub` itself supports basic looping at the command line with what it calls *array jobs*.  Essentially, `qsub` itself sets up a loop like the one above; you can access the loop index through the environment variable `$SGE_TASK_ID`.  So, let's rewrite the `sim` executable:

{% include pre-file.html file="sim" %}
#!/bin/bash
R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore "--args $SGE_TASK_ID" sim.R .sim.Rout
{% include post-file.html %}

Now, we can run

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
qsub -t 1-15 sim
{% include post-prompt.html %}

This will accomplish the same thing as the scripted loop above, but without the need to write a `batch-sim` file.
