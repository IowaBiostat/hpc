# Transferring files (Windows)

To do any meaningful work on Argon, you will probably have to transfer files back and forth (pushing data sets and programs you've written out to Argon, pulling results from Argon to back to your machine, etc.).  These are the instructions for Windows; Linux instructions are below.

The easiest way to transfer files on a Windows machine is to simply mount your home directory on Argon so that it appears on your local machine as a regular directory.  Click on Computer > Map network drive, then enter `\\argon-home.hpc.uiowa.edu\argon_home` as the Folder.  Done!

It is possible to set this up on a Linux/Mac machine, although you will have to have IT set it up for you as it requires administrative privileges on your machine.

# Transferring files (Linux/Mac: scp)

The basic way to transfer files from a Linux/Mac terminal is `scp`:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
scp -P 40 file.txt argon.hpc.uiowa.edu:
{% include post-prompt.html %}

This will copy the file `file.txt` from your current working directory to your home directory on Argon.  Note the `-P 40` option to specify port 40; this is not necessary on-campus (but doesn't hurt either).  To copy a directory, you need to specify the `-r` option:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
scp -r -P 40 mydir argon.hpc.uiowa.edu:
{% include post-prompt.html %}

# Transferring files (Linux/Mac: rsync)

Another useful option to know about for directories is `rsync`.  The advantage of `rsync` is that it only copies files that have changed between the two directories.  So for example, suppose you copy a directory containing large amounts of data to Argon, analyze the data using Argon, then want to copy the directory back.  This will be very inefficient, since the data is unchanged -- you really just want to copy the files that have changed.  You could do this manually, but rsync automates the process:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
rsync -avz -e "ssh -p 40" --delete mydir/ argon.hpc.uiowa.edu:mydir/
{% include post-prompt.html %}

This will synchronize the `mydir` directory on Argon with the one on your local machine.  Note that the above code is a little aggressive; the `--delete` option means that if a file on `mydir` on Argon does not exist on your local `mydir`, it will be deleted from Argon (in other words, the two directories will look exactly the same once the above command is finished).  You can read the full `rsync` documentation to find out more about all the options.

To synchronize in the opposite direction (i.e., make your local `mydir` folder look exactly like the one on Argon), simply reverse the order of the last two arguments:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
rsync -avz -e "ssh -p 40" --delete argon.hpc.uiowa.edu:mydir/ mydir/
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Again, be careful while doing this, as you could inadvertently delete files in your local directory.

# Transferring files using `git`

Both of the Linux/Mac options given above are not as useful as they used to be, now that the Argon cluster requires dual-factor authentication.  Another option that I have found useful is to set up a git repository for your code, then push/pull as needed.  If you know how `git` works, then this is self-explanatory; if you don't, well, [that's a separate tutorial](http://gitimmersion.com).
