# Login nodes vs. compute nodes

Neon consists of 2 login nodes and 259 compute nodes.  Basically, you log in to
the login nodes and submit commands to be run on the compute nodes.  Two of
the compute nodes belong to the Department of Biostatistics; the remaining 257
belong to other researchers throughout the University, or are dedicated for
general use (i.e., belong to the University as a whole).

When you log in to Neon, your commands will be running on one of the two login
nodes.  These nodes are shared by everyone at the University of Iowa who uses
the Neon cluster.  It is extremely important that you do not run
computer-intensive jobs on the login nodes -- if the login nodes are occupied,
no one can access the compute nodes.  This is the cardinal rule of using the cluster:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<b>Do not run computer-intensive jobs on the login nodes.</b>
</blockquote>

Running computer-intensive jobs is what the compute nodes are for.
