# Login nodes vs. compute nodes

Argon consists of 2 login nodes and hundreds of compute nodes.  Basically, you
log in to the login nodes and submit commands to be run on the compute nodes.
Several (at the time of this writing, 5) of the compute nodes belong to the
Department of Biostatistics; the remaining nodes belong to other researchers
throughout the University, or are dedicated for general use (i.e., belong to the
University as a whole).

When you log in to Argon, your commands will be running on one of the two login
nodes.  These nodes are shared by everyone at the University of Iowa who uses
the Argon cluster.  It is extremely important that you do not run
computer-intensive jobs on the login nodes -- if the login nodes are occupied,
no one can access the compute nodes.  This is the cardinal rule of using the cluster:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<b>Do not run computer-intensive jobs on the login nodes.</b>
</blockquote>

Running computer-intensive jobs is what the compute nodes are for.
