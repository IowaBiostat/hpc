# Getting the Latest Version of R


The R modules available on the HPC machines occasionally lag behind the current version of R available from CRAN. Fortunately, we do not have to rely on the Environment Module system to provide all the software we need.

## Setting up dependencies

Compiling software can often be an exercise in frustration for new Linux users, but it doesn't have to be particularly difficult. The first thing we need to do on the HPC infrastructure is load the modules which are prerequisite to building a copy of R.

You can load these dependencies one by one (`gcc`, `zlib`, `bzip2`, `xz`, `pcre`, `curl`, `jdk`, etc.), but a simpler solution is just to add

{% include pre-file.html file=".bash_profile" %}
module load python/3.7.0
{% include post-file.html %}

to your `.bash_profile` file.  R doesn't actually need Python in order to compile, but all of R's dependencies are also Python dependencies (at least, as of this writing!).  So when you load python, it loads all of those `gcc`, `zlib`, etc., dependencies.  You can then proceed to compile R.

Note that if you want to compile R using, say, Open MPI, you would want to replace the above with `module load python/3.7.0_openmpi-2.1.2`.

## Compiling R

**NOTE:** Please compile R on a compute node, not a login node; i.e., run [`qlogin`](6.html) first.
 
Next, we'll need to download a copy of R. You may consider placing this in a subfolder of your home directory:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
mkdir ~/buildR && cd ~/buildR
{% include post-prompt.html %}

R can be downloaded using the `wget` program, and you can find the link to the latest source distribution at the [official CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/).

At the time of this writing, the latest version was R-3.4.2:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.4.2.tar.gz
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Once you've downloaded the file, you can extract it using the [easy to remember](https://xkcd.com/1168/)

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
tar -xvf R-3.4.2.tar.gz
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Assuming that you have extracted the archive successfully, we next need to configure it. 

{% include pre-prompt.html more="$" %}
cd ./R-3.4.2
./configure
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Pay attention to any error messages, particularly at the end of the long stream of output. This will indicate if any functionality R is expecting to find on the system was not found. Usually, this indicates that you need to load additional modules. 

If the configure script executed without issues, you're now ready to compile the code. It's possible to use multiple cores to compile code (the following example uses two cores), but please don't do so on the login node.

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
make -j 2
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Once this command executes successfully, you're ready to start using R! The compiled binary is located in `~/buildR/R-3.4.2/bin`

You can make things easier by aliasing `R` to point to this compiled R package:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
alias -p R="~/buildR/R-3.4.2bin/R"
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Be sure to include this alias in your `.bash_profile`, or another startup script you call on each node before executing your jobs.
