# Getting the Latest Version of R


R development happens at a rapid pace - much faster than the rate at which new R modules are added to the HPC infrastructure. Fortunately, we do not have to rely on the Environment Module system to provide all the software we need. 

Compiling software can often be an exercise in frustration for new Linux users, but it doesn't have to be particularly difficult. The first thing we need to do on the HPC infrastructure is load the modules which are prerequisite to building a copy of R. Note that you may choose to use different modules than we present here, particularly if you want to compile R with a different compiler.
 
For convenience, you may wish to add these module calls to a separate script file, or to your `.bash_profile`, as you will have to load them each time you want to execute your custom R build, including on the compute nodes. 


{% include pre-file.html file="envsetup" %}
#!/bin/bash
module load gcc/4.9.3
module load zlib/1.2.8
module load bzip2/1.0.6
module load xz/5.2.2
module load pcre/8.38
module load 7.49.1
module load curl/7.48.1
module load jdk/8u92
{% include post-file.html %}

Next, we'll need to download a copy of R. You may consider placing this in a subfolder of your home directory:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
mkdir ~/buildR && cd ~/buildR
{% include post-prompt.html %}

R can be downloaded using the `wget` program, and you can find the link to the latest source distribution at the [official CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/).

At the time of this writing, the latest version was R-3.4.2:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.4.2.tar.gz
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Once you've downloaded the file, you can extract it using the [easy to remember](https://xkcd.com/1168/)

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
tar -xvf R-3.4.2.tar.gz
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Assuming that you have extracted the archive successfully, we next need to configure it. 

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
cd ./R-3.4.2 && ./configure
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Pay attention to any error messages, particularly at the end of the long stream of output. This will indicate if any functionality R is expecting to find on the system was not found. Usually, this indicates that you need to load additional modules. 

If the configure script executed without issues, you're now ready to compile the code. Note: it's possible to use multiple cores to compile code, but please be considerate of other users on the login node. 

The following example uses two cores, but adds the 'nice' modifier to prevent interruptions to other users. 

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
nice make -j 2
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Once this command executes successfully, you're ready to start using R! The compiled binary is located in `~/buildR/R-3.4.2/bin`

You can make things easier by aliasing `R` to point to this compiled R package:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
alias -p R="~/buildR/R-3.4.2bin/R"
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Be sure to include this alias in your `.bash_profile`, or another startup script you call on each node before executing your jobs.
