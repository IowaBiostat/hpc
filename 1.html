###### Connecting to Neon (Linux/Mac terminal)

You can connect to the Neon cluster on a Linux or Mac machine (or using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> on Windows) by opening a terminal and using ssh with your HawkID and password:

<div class="code">
  <div class="prompt">
>
  </div>
<pre class="code">
ssh neon.hpc.uiowa.edu
</pre>
</div>

Note that if, on the machine you're using, your username is not the same as your HawkID, you'll have to specify your login username:

<div class="code">
  <div class="prompt">
>
  </div>
<pre class="code">
ssh hawkid@neon.hpc.uiowa.edu
</pre>
</div>

By default, ssh uses port 22, which is blocked from outside connections by the University of Iowa network.  So if you are connecting from off-campus, you will have to specify port 40:

<div class="code">
  <div class="prompt">
>
  </div>
<pre class="code">
ssh -p 40 neon.hpc.uiowa.edu
</pre>
</div>

Note, however, that you do not have to set up a VPN to connect to Neon.

###### Connecting to Neon (Windows)

On a Windows machine, you can use <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> to connect to Neon in essentially the same way as above, only with a GUI interface.  Just be sure to specify:

<ul>
  <li> Connection: SSH (default)</li>
  <li> Host Name: neon.hpc.uiowa.edu</li>
  <li> Port: 22 (default) is fine on-campus, but you need to specify 40 if you're connecting from off-campus</li>
</ul>

You will then be prompted for your username (HawkID) and password.

###### Connecting by Remote Desktop

It is also possible to connect to Neon by remote desktop using <a href="http://www.nomachine.com/download.php">NoMachine NX</a>.  I have never personally done this, but instructions are available <a href="https://www.icts.uiowa.edu/confluence/display/ICTSit/NoMachine+Client+Instructions+for+Connecting+to+Helium">here</a>.  If anyone has tried this out and has any tips to share, let me know and I will make them available here.
