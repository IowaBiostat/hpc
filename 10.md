# qbatch

Another option for easily submitting array jobs is `qbatch`. To use `qbatch`, create a text file with one command per line. For example:

{% include pre-file.html file="batch.txt" %}
R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore "--args 1" sim.R .sim.Rout
R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore "--args 2" sim.R .sim.Rout
R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore "--args hello" sim.R .sim.Rout
R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore "--args world" sim.R .sim.Rout
{% include post-file.html %}

Then we can submit this as an array job with 4 cores (one per line) via:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
qbatch -q BIOSTAT batch.txt
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Note that doing so creates some temporary files in a hidden folder `.qbatch` and stores the `batch.txt.o5508677.4`, etc., files in a folder called `logs` (obviously, you can change these defaults if you want to).

If you want to have each job run more than one line, you can change the "chunk size":

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
qbatch -q BIOSTAT -c 2 batch.txt
{% include post-prompt.html %}

This will submit 2 jobs: job 1 will run lines 1 and 2, job 2 will run lines 3 and 4.

If you want each job to use more than 1 processor, you can change the processors per job:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
qbatch -q BIOSTAT -c 2 --ppj 2 batch.txt
{% include post-prompt.html %}

This will again submit 2 jobs, but run those jobs on 4 cores -- each job is working with 2 cores. Note that these jobs still run consecutively, however (line 2 waits for line 1 to finish). If you want to run multiple commands in parallel, specify the `-j` argument:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
qbatch -q BIOSTAT -c 2 --ppj 2 -j 2 batch.txt
{% include post-prompt.html %}

This submit 2 jobs on 4 cores and engages all 4 cores simultaneously -- job 1 runs lines 1 and 2 on two different processors, while job 2 runs lines 3 and 4 on different processors. This should provide all the flexibility you need to configure the submission of your jobs how you like, but [consult the documentation](https://pypi.org/project/qbatch/) for a full explanation of all available options.

# Submitting a single shell command

Another thing `qbatch` is useful for is submission of single shell commands. For example:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
qbatch -q BIOSTAT -- ls
{% include post-prompt.html %}

This submits the simple listing command `ls` as a `qsub` job.

Most shell commands (such as `ls`) obviously don't need to be submitted to compute nodes. However, this feature is often useful -- for example, maybe you have an executable shell command `fit_model` that fits some time-consuming model. Perhaps you originally worked on it and run it interactively in a `qlogin` session, but now you need to refit the model for some reason. You could `qlogin` again, but it's much more convenient to simply run `qbatch -- fit_model`.
