# qlogin

The simplest thing you can do with the cluster is to just log in to the BIOSTAT
node and run things on it interactively.  Once you're logged in, it is just like
being logged in remotely to any other computer.  However, logging in must be
accomplished through the scheduler to balance requests for interactive and
non-interactive sessions and to send requests to the proper queues.  To set up
an interactive session, use `qlogin`:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
qlogin -q BIOSTAT
{% include post-prompt.html %}

The `-q BIOSTAT` option specifies that you would like to log in to the BIOSTAT node.
You can, of course, try to log in interactively to a different node with `-q
UI`, if one is available, or use `-q all.q` to log in with the understanding
that you will get logged off if someone wants their node back.

**IMPORTANT:** By default, the above command will allocate <em>all of the
available processors on the node</em> to your `qlogin` request.  In other words,
you may be requesting dozens of processors that no one else will be able to use
until you log out (which you would do by typing `exit` or `Ctrl+D`).  This is
particularly bad if you only need a small number of processors, or if you intend
to stay logged in for a long period of time (or both!).  To request an
interactive session that uses only, say, 4 processors, submit:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
qlogin -q BIOSTAT -pe smp 4
{% include post-prompt.html %}

The `-pe` option specifies the parallel environment you wish to have for your
`qlogin` session.  There are various options, the differences between which get
rather technical, but the simplest is SMP (symmetric multiprocessing).

From here, you can do anything you would normally do at a terminal -- run commands, run an interactive R session, etc.  There are three primary reasons one might be interested in doing this:

* Your own computer has insufficient computational resources to run the interactive R session you have in mind.
* You need to set something up on the cluster, but don't want to tie up a login node.
* You want to make sure a job will run on Argon or troubleshoot why it isn't running (it can be difficult to do this non-interactively).

It is worth noting that `qlogin` respects X11 forwarding, so if you log in using
`ssh -X` or `ssh -Y`, or you are using NoMachine, you can do things like view
plots in R that are created on the compute node.

**AGAIN:** Try not to abuse `qlogin` by staying logged in for long periods of time or requesting far more slots than you are actually going to use.  This ties up resources that other people may be trying to use.
