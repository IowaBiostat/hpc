# Compiling R

The R modules available on the HPC machines are usually fairly up to date, so you likely don't need to use the information on this page, but if you want the absolutely latest version of R, or a development version, you can compile it yourself.

## Setting up dependencies

Compiling software can often be an exercise in frustration for new Linux users, but it doesn't have to be particularly difficult. The first thing we need to do on the HPC infrastructure is load the modules which R depends on.

You can load these dependencies one by one (`gcc`, `zlib`, `bzip2`, `xz`, `pcre`, `curl`, `jdk`, etc.), but a simpler solution is:

{% include pre-prompt.html more="$" %}
module load jags
module load pcre2
{% include post-prompt.html %}

R doesn't actually need jags, of course, but all of R's dependencies are also JAGS dependencies (at least, as of this writing!), except for `pcre2`.

## Compiling R

**NOTE:** Please compile R on a compute node, not a login node; i.e., run [`q_login`](6.html) first.
 
Next, we'll need to download a copy of R. You may consider placing this in a subfolder of your home directory:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
mkdir ~/buildR && cd ~/buildR
{% include post-prompt.html %}

R can be downloaded using the `wget` program, and you can find the link to the latest source distribution at the [official CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/).

For example, suppose we want to compile R-3.4.2:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.4.2.tar.gz
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Once you've downloaded the file, you can extract it using the [easy to remember](https://xkcd.com/1168/)

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
tar -xvf R-3.4.2.tar.gz
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Assuming that you have extracted the archive successfully, we next need to configure it. 

{% include pre-prompt.html more="$" %}
cd ./R-3.4.2
./configure
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Pay attention to any error messages, particularly at the end of the long stream of output. This will indicate if any functionality R is expecting to find on the system was not found. Usually, this indicates that you need to load additional modules.

If the configure script executed without issues, you're now ready to compile the code. It's possible to use multiple cores to compile code (the following example uses two cores), but please don't do so on the login node.

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
make -j 2
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Once this command executes successfully, you're ready to start using R! The compiled binary is located in `~/buildR/R-3.4.2/bin`

You can make things easier by aliasing `R` to point to this compiled R package:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
alias -p R="~/buildR/R-3.4.2/bin/R"
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Be sure to include this alias in your `.bash_profile`, or another startup script you call on each node before executing your jobs.
