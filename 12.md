# MCMC

One final common task in statistical computing that is (for the most part) easy
to parallelize is the estimation of posterior distributions using Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation.  Although an individual chain is difficult to
parallelize, one can carry out the estimation by running multiple chains, and
this is easily accomplished in parallel.

There are several programs (BUGS, JAGS, Stan) that accept a specified model and
carry out sampling from the posterior.  We will focus here on JAGS, simply
because that is the one I am most familiar with.  JAGS is installed on Neon at
`/Shared/Tukey/jags`; to run it, add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` file:

{% include pre-file.html file=".bash_profile" %}
<...more...>
export PATH=~/bin:/Shared/Tukey/jags/bin:$PATH:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/Shared/Tukey/jags/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Shared/Tukey/jags/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
module load gcc/4.8.2
<...more...>
{% include post-file.html %}

We will use data from a two-factor study of pilot response to loss of aircraft
control carried out in a flight simulator ([raw data here](misc/flight.txt)).
The two factors are type of training that the pilot received and the scenario
that was simulated.  A reasonable model for this data is the following:

{% include pre-file.html file="model.txt" %}
model {
  ## Likelihood
  for (i in 1:n) {
    y[i] ~ dbern(theta[i])
    logit(theta[i]) <- mu + a[aid[i]] + b[uid[i]]
  }
  
  ## Priors
  mu ~ dnorm(0, 0.0001)
  for (j in 1:J) {
    a[j] ~ dnorm(0, sigma[1]^(-2))
  }
  for (k in 1:K) {
    b[k] ~ dnorm(0, sigma[2]^(-2))
  }
  for (i in 1:2) {
    sigma[i] ~ dunif(0, 5)
  }
}
{% include post-file.html %}

JAGS (and BUGS and Stan) can be run from the command line, and thus you could
write your own scripts to call and run them in parallel.  However, this is a
common enough task that people have already written packages to do this from
within R; one such package is `runjags`.  Here is how we would fit the above
model in R (either interactively or not), here specifying that we want 10
chains, each with 10,000 draws (the default in `runjags` is a burn-in of 4,000,
so we're drawing 14,000 samples from each chain, but only keeping the last
10,000).

{% include pre-file.html file="mcmc.R" %}
Data <- read.delim("http://myweb.uiowa.edu/pbreheny/neon/misc/flight.txt")
jData <- list(aid = as.numeric(Data$Scenario),
              uid = as.numeric(Data$Group),
              J = length(levels(Data$Scenario)),
              K = length(levels(Data$Group)),
              y = Data$Recovered,
              n = nrow(Data))
monitor <- c("mu", "a", "b", "sigma")
FUN <- function(chain) {list(mu=rnorm(1), sigma=rexp(2), a=rnorm(max(jData$aid)), b=rnorm(max(jData$uid)))}
inits <- mapply(FUN, 1:10, SIMPLIFY=FALSE)
require(runjags)
runjags.options(rng.warning=FALSE) ## I'm happy to let runjags worry about the RNG details;
                                   ## I prefer not to be warned about it
fit <- run.jags("model.txt", monitor=monitor, data=jData, inits=inits, n.chains=length(inits), method="parallel", sample=10000)

# To convert from runjags format to other popular formats:
require(coda)
MCMC <- as.mcmc.list(fit) ## Convert to coda format
require(R2jags)
Fit <- R2jags:::mcmc2bugs(MCMC, program="jags") ## Convert to R2jags format

# Posterior summaries:
Fit
plot(Fit)
{% include post-file.html %}

The above code can be run either interactively through `qlogin` or with `qsub`.
Either way, you will want to specify the `-pe smp 10` flag to ensure that you
have 10 processors available (if you only have one processor available, you'll
have to run the 10 chains sequentially, which will of course be about 10 times
slower).  For example:

{% include pre-prompt.html %}
qsub -pe smp 10 -q TUKEY ~/bin/rbatch mcmc.R
{% include post-prompt.html %}

Note that in the end, we obtain 100,000 draws from the posterior distribution.  As the summaries inform us, this data indicates that there is little reason to think that type of training had any impact on pilot's ability to recover aircraft control, although scenario certainly had an effect (some simulated scenarios were much more difficult than others).
